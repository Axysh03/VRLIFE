# Life simulator
This is a vanillaJS life simulator heavily inspired in games like bitlife, instlife and altlife. You can work, interact with your relatives, get a job, get an university career, improve your skills, buy stuff and **kill** (I havent implemented prison yet tho).

## About the project
Its not finished yet, I will be constantly updating this, bringing new content, bug fixes and UI improvements
